- When resolving rolls, change resolved die color to "inactive" after the die has been resolved

- Special dice status colors?
  - For lightning armor etc.
  
- "beat-up" graphics in the character icons?

- Attack animations:
  - Monster icon to "do stuff"
    - To the direction of the attackee?
  - Claw dice to "laser" target monsters
    - Could be combined with a "chest thump" (non-directional attack animation) in the monster icon
