This directory contains scripts for automatically generating the ROK card
images, based on the card properties data in ROKServerGame.js.

The PHP script that generates the images requires Imagemagick with Pango (
but not IMagick!).

To generate the image files:

- To get latest card data from the game, run:
$ node extract_cards.js > cards.json

- Then, to generate a card, run generate.php and give the card id as a
  parameter:
$ ./generate.php 1

The card image file will be created within ready-images
